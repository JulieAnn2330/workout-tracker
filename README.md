<h3 id='description'>Description of Project</h3>
<p>This interactive application allows the user to enter and track their exercises and workouts and view related stats. This application was a homework assignment for the University of Kansas Bootcamp This application is great for users who are motivated by tracking their workout data and seeing a statistical history of workouts. I learned a lot about MongoDB in this project. I'd never worked with a seed file before so figuring out the functionality of that was definitely a learning curve. I also am continuing to develop my Heroku skills -- I didn't have as many problems connecting this project as I have in the past. One thing that makes my project stand out is the addition of the buttons to the nav bar on the index and exercise html pages. They were links before, but the underline of the link is turned so you couldn't that they were two separate links. I had a hard realizing that the reason my stats wouldn't show when I clicked them all the time is because it wasn't all just one link as it appeared to be. This project features input values, drop-downs and incremental values. The stats page is my favorite part of the project.</p><br>

<h3 id='use'>How to Use the Project</h3>
<p>When logging in for the first time the user will be prompted to Create Your First Workout. A returning user will have the option to Continue Workout or enter a New Workout. To add a resistance exercise choose the exercise type from the dropdown, then follow the rest of the prompts to enter the name of the workout,  the weight in pounds, the number of sets, the number of reps and the duration of the exercise in minutes. If it is a cardio workout, the user will be prompted to enter the name of the workout, the distance in miles and the duration in minutes. To view the user stats, click on the Dashboard button in the upper left corner. The Fitness Tracker button will take the user back to the home page.</p><br>
